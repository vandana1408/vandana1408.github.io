        <p>Hi guys :). I'm Vandana; the Gen Z Grandma.</p>
    
        <p>I'm 20 years old and a full-time university student studying Bioinformatics Engineering, but when I'm not stressing over a massive COMP assignment, I like to knit and crochet.</p>
    
        <p>While I've known how to knit since I was 7, I developed my passion for the hobby during lockdown in 2020. Bored out of my mind, I set out to knit 180 patches all 15cm x 15cm,
    made from the scrap wool I've bought in previous years. This took me about 5 months to complete. Ever since then I haven't stopped. I even picked up crochet last year which has to 
    be my favourite form of manipulating yarn into clothing. Since then I have grown to really enjoy designing and creating new things and finding versatility in the things I make. </p>
    
        <p>Some of my other hobbies include: reading, bullet journalling and playing the piano very irregularly. In the future I hope to be able to create patterns for my designs or create my own 
    clothing line. I also want to balance this with my career in STEM and improve my coding skills (which is why I built this website).</p>
    
        <p>~ Vandana.</p>  </div>
