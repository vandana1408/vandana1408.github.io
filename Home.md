# About me

I studied Bioinformatics Engineering (Hons) as my undergraduate degree, where after a few frustrating nights completing a coding assignment, something finally clicked and I found my love for all things programming. During this time I also partook in societies such as the UNSW Bioinformatics Society by hosting their events and UNSW Knitting and Crochet Society, in a marketing position. This is where I gained the people skills that brought me here.  

I'm now completing an Engineering Graduate Program, with my first rotation in the HR function that supports over 48,900 employees. I've been gaining experience with Workday, specifically Workday Extend. My most recent project is a templating repository that improves the Workday Extend Developing experience by providing reusable frontend components and automating repetitive functions for build and testing stages. 

My favourite language is Python because you can never be a complete expert on it. However, I really want to expand my tech stack abilities and learn React, .NET and C++. My other engineering goals would be getting AWS Certifications and more cloud experience in turn. 

Outside of work, I enjoy knitting/crochet and reading! I'm a sucker for a good thriller/mystery novel and have made nearly half my wadrobe by knitting or crocheting my clothes.
