I've always tried to find a nice way to show off who I am and the work that I do. I've experimented with everything from Hugo, to a Wordpress blog, all the way back to Hugo and now finally xlog.

# About me
Currently, I work as a systems engineer within a HR function that supports over 48,900 employees. The platform I have the most experience with is Workday, specifically a product called Workday Extend.

I'm expanding my repotoire though-- I'm making my way through the AWS certifications and recently got my AWS Cloud Practitioner and I'm working towards my AWS Developer Associate. I'm a big Python fan and try to use it as much as I can. I also enjoy writing Javascript on Node and have started exploring Rust (typical, I know).

I got into engineering and technology through Lego which then snowballed into a couple of small ventures from the end of highschool well through to the end of my degree. Like every *technologist*, I experiment with a home server and obsess over home automation.
