        is one of my favourite works, made for my sister's birthday. Earlier this year I designed and made a similar jumper
      with the colours black and wisteria but made a few modificiations based on what I learnt the first time. I still love the way this 
      turned out and it has to be one of my favourite works.</div>

        combining both my knitting and crochet abilities. The photo below was actually taken on my birthday from the view at the front of my house. I just love how everything here turned out.</div>

        I really wanted to make a patchwork cardigan with a warm theme. This is my work in progress because I haven't finished it yet.
      All my winter projects are currently on pause due to being in lockdown for most of winter but I'm really excited for the final result.</div>
